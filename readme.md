## Project Description

This is the repository for CS440 FA21 with professor Boularias Abdeslam

## Assignment 1

Overview: This assignment is to implement A* algorithm in a maze and compare the effect of varieted factors on run time

What [XiaoweiZhang](https://github.com/XiaoweiZhang-0) have done:
```
1. Implemented a maze generator to randomly generate a maze of given size with 30% block rate using DFS algorithm
2. Implemented repeated A* algorithm to simulate path-searching action
3. Adjusted A* algorithm to break ties in favor of cells with larger g-value and compared to A* in favor of smaller g-value in terms of running time
4. Implemented backward A* algorithm to search from the goal and compared to forward A* in terms of running time
5. Implemented adaptive A* with new heuristic evaluation method and compared to normal A* with mahattan distance as heuristic in terms of running time
```
## Final Project

Overview: This assignment is to use three different machine learning techniques---naive bayes, perceptron, and logistic regression for OCR with digits and face recognition

What [XiaoweiZhang](https://github.com/XiaoweiZhang-0) have done:
```
1.Fixed the provided code and upgraded it for Python 3.0(Previous was for Python 2.0)
2.Implemented logistic regression from scratch including feature normalization, batch update, and autotune for best hyperparameter.
3.Fixed bugs in naive bayes code to raise its test accuracy to 77% for OCR with digits and 88% for face recognition.
4.Result: All three algorithms have at least 75% accuracy for OCR with digits and 85% accuracy for face recognition
```
