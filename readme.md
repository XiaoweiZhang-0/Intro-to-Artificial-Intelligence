# Assignment 1

```
What I have done:
1.Implemented a maze generator to randomly generate a maze of given size with 30% block rate using DFS algorithm
2.Implemented repeated A* algorithm to simulate path-searching action
3.Adjusted A* algorithm to break ties in favor of cells with larger g-value and compared to A* in favor of smaller g-value in terms of running time
4.Implemented backward A* algorithm to search from the goal and compared to forward A* in terms of running time
5.Implemented adaptive A* with new heuristic evaluation method and compared to normal A* with mahattan distance as heuristic in terms of running time
